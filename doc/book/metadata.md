abstract: Direct Access Memory for a Multi-Processor System on Chip. A Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) is a System on Chip (SoC) which includes multiple Processing Units (PU). As such, it is a Multi-Core System-on-Chip. All PUs are linked to each other by a Network on Chip (NoC). These technologies meet the performance needs of multimedia applications, telecommunication architectures or network security. A Direct Memory Access (DMA) is a feature of computer systems that allows hardware subsystems to access main system memory (Random Access Memory), independent of the Processing Unit (PU). A PU inside a SoC can transfer data to and from its local memory without occupying its processor time, allowing computation and data transfer to proceed in parallel.
